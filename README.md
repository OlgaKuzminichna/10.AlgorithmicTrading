# Algorithmic trading Project

The goal of the project is to practice:
* data collection and management,
* financial data analysis,
* risk management and reporting, 
* robust software design.

To achieve the goal, I have executed 3 algorithmic trading strategy, conducted back-testing for each of them, plus two have live paper-trading. 

I conducted the back-testing using historical data to assess its performance. The historical data was obtained from deribit.com and covers the time period from July 4th, 2023, at 7:00 AM to July 7th, 2023, at 7:00 PM. For the code please see BackTest.ipynb
The livetesting was run for 6 hours for 2 strategies. The code can be seen in livetesting.ipynb
